# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Data-Mining

Data Mining is supposed to be the process of exploration through data in order to understand and predict new algorithms to understand and predict the future. It helps in taking a step ahead for analyzing the future. The process of data mining contains three important major steps, which is considered to be foundation. They are Statistics which is the numeric study of data relationships, Artificial Intelligence which is the human-like intelligence displayed by software and/or machines, and Machine Learning which is the algorithms for understanding the data for the purpose of prediction.

With the advance technologies, the processes are becoming much liberal and much easy and understandable to implement compared with the manual and time-consuming processes which we had. Business sectors like Banks, Manufactures, Retailers etc. are now using the advance technologies in data mining in order to understand the future with regards to the future price predictions, to understand the consumer trends etc.

Twitter is an American online social and news networking services on which the different people use different modes to communicate their emotions which are collectively called as tweets. These tweets can be seen by the public, anyhow the senders have the option to restrict them as well. Each tweets are restricted to 280 characters. The tweets are widely being utilized for many purposes like, for movie reviews, to understand the current trends, the ideologies etc. Our main aim of the assignment is to build a model to detect and summarize the sentiments using the tweets on random topics. 

The whole idea of this analytical process was carried out with the CRISP-DM data modelling steps. By keeping in mind the advantages of this model, we started to build ahead by splitting the whole data mining process into six steps, and these are as follows,

•	Business Understanding,
•	Data Understanding,
•	Data Preparation,
•	Modelling,
•	Evaluation, 
•	Deployment.

No matter which organization is implementing this model, the result can be accurately understood by providing a schema to follow while the preparation, planning and the final execution of data mining work.
